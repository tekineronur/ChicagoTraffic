# Fatal Traffic Accidents in Chicago City
# Summary
This project looked at traffic accidents in Chicago to understand when and why they happen. I found that accidents at night, especially from 7 PM to 5 AM, are more serious. This is because it's harder to see, making accidents more likely to be fatal. I also explored which days have more accidents.

# Introduction
I wanted to learn why accidents happen and if certain times or days are more dangerous. For example, I noticed that many people relax and have fun on Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays. I wondered if these days have more accidents. Accidents affect everyone, and in the US, there were around 40,000 fatal crashes in 2021.


# Data Description
I used data about traffic accidents from Chicago's government website from 2017 to 2023. It had about 362,881 records.

# Data Preparation
I cleaned the data by removing empty columns and filling in missing values for some details like locations.

# Data Analysis
I checked if there's a link between 'Hit and Run' incidents and injuries. I also studied fatal accidents during different times and days. Plus, I looked into what causes fatal and non-fatal accidents.

# Results
Accidents at night seem to be riskier, maybe because it's harder to see.
Fridays and Sundays had more fatal accidents, though it's a bit different from national statistics.
Different factors like lighting conditions and types of crashes show how serious accidents can be.
Discussion
There weren't many fatal accidents in the dataset, so it might not show the full picture. Also, we should define what makes an accident 'fatal' or 'non-fatal' better.

# Conclusion
Accidents are more dangerous at night due to visibility issues. But, we need more data to fully understand why accidents happen.

# Future Work
I want to get more data to understand things like alcohol involvement, weather conditions, and road quality in causing accidents.
